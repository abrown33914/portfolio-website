# Allison Brown — Portfolio Website

Welcome! This personal portfolio shares a snapshot of my work, interests, and experience.

You'll find:

- A short introduction and photo
- A selection of projects with images and brief descriptions
- Highlights of skills and experience
- Easy ways to get in touch

The site is designed to be clean and simple — no heavy jargon, just the essentials so visitors can quickly see what I build and how to reach me.

This site is hosted through GitHub Pages at the custom domain: www.allisonbrown.dev
